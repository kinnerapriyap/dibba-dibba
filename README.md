# dibba-dibba

#### Named after

[Dibba rotti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dibba_Roti.JPG) is a bread from Andhra Pradesh, India (where we're from ðŸ’š). Growing up, this was a quick make - spicy and filling - for when we came home hungry. 

I still make it on days when I've had dosa every day the week before (which is not an issue in itself because I could eat dosa forever which reminds me I should make something in Kotlin that's called dosa soon but anyway). It can be eaten with a variety of toppings (read everything) <i>sooooooo</i>

### How to play

1. 3D print as many sets of 4 coloured dice (Blue/Yellow/Green/Red) as the number of players - Download the 3d model file [here](/dibba-dibba-die.3mf).
2. Run this web app written in Kotlin with `run -t`.
3. Click to randomise the dibba and see who can put it together first!
